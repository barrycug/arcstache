Core Ideas:
- take a layer/Z/R/C request (check tilestache)
- optional &f=esri if we are asking for Esri Geometry
- if .json file exists on disk, if not
	- convert Z,R,C into a bounding box
	- query layer for...
		- points inside the box
		- lines that intersect the box
		- polys who's centroids insersect the box
	- generalize as needed (based on  Z)
	- cache file in both formats
	- stream back requested format
else
	- stream back requested format


Tasks:
- get natural earth data so we have global coverage (easier for testing)
